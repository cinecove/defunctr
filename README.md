Defunctr detects which browser is visiting your site by detecting feature sets the browser supports. The purpose is to allow UX changes where a change must be made explicitly to an older browser. Using user-agent detection easily fails and apply browser hacks do not work in all cases. Defunctr makes this detection available in two ways: as properties on a global `Defunctr` object, and as classes on the `<html>` element. This information allows you to enhance your pages with a granular level of control.

Defunctr has the ability to exclude testing and tagging by appending any of the following classes to your pages `<html>` element:

* `defunctr-ie-only`: Defunctr will only include ie testing
* `defunctr-version-off`: Defunctr will not add browser version classes to the `<head>` element
* `defunctr-lt-off`: Defunctr will not add less than version classes to the `<head>` elememnt
* `defunctr-gt-off`: Defunctr will not add greater than version classes to the `<head>` element
